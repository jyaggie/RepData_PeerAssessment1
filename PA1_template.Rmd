## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(xtable)
library(dplyr)
activity<-read.table("activity.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactor=FALSE, sep=",")
activity_wo_na<-activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]

```







## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
grouped_by_day<- group_by(activity_wo_na, date)
summary_steps <- summarise(grouped_by_day,
  total = sum(steps))
  mean(summary_steps$total)
   median(summary_steps$total)
   hist(summary_steps$total, xlab="Total Number of Steps", main="Frequency of Total Number of Steps per Day", col=3)
   
   

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r echo=TRUE}
grouped_by_day<- group_by(activity_wo_na, interval)
 summary_steps <- summarise(grouped_by_day,  total = mean(steps))
 x<- c("Midnight", "5:00AM", "10:00AM", "3:00PM", "8:00PM")
plot(summary_steps$total~summary_steps$interval, type="l",  xaxt="n")
 axis(1, at=c(0,500,1000,1500,2000),labels=x, col.axis="red")
```




## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
